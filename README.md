ListViewAnimation-Xamarin.Forms
===============================

After building sample app for Xamarin.Android [here](https://github.com/kirtisagar/ListViewAnimationXamarin.Android), I have created the sample for Xamarin.Forms. Beauty of this sample is, its uses DependencyService to find the ListView and apply the animation using [nhaarman/ListViewAnimations](https://github.com/nhaarman/ListViewAnimations) Java binding project.

**Note**:This sample contains only Xamarin.Andriod implementation for Xamarin.Forms. 

Apply animation to the ListView by using existing java library in Xamarin.Forms.

I have created ListView animation using [nhaarman/ListViewAnimations](https://github.com/nhaarman/ListViewAnimations) java project. See the [Play Store Demo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haarman.listviewanimations)

Demo includes the Appearance Animation. When the ListView items appears first time. If you want to know more and change the animation type follow this guide: https://github.com/nhaarman/ListViewAnimations/wiki/Appearance-Animations
